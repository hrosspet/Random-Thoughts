Random Thoughts
===============

This project is a platform for sharing random ideas. Github is usually used for sharing computer code, but I think it could be used in a similar way for something different. For open sourcing our thoughts. This is the way how to push blog-writing to another level, because here you are allowed not just to read my ideas and comment under the posts. On github you can actively take part in my writing.

I invite you to read my ideas, find the flaws in them, correct them, extend them, finish them, and share them.
